============

This is my attempt at automating part of my workflow using AWS to help working on Kaggle challenges.


# Setup

- AWS credentials in ~/.boto
- For batch jobs, Docker image in aamaia/kaggle-batch

# TODO: batch workflow

- create & configure s3 bucket if needed
- launching spot instance
- collect output


# TODO: interactive workflow

- prepare image with jupyter and letsencrypt
